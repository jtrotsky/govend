A Go Library for Vend
========

This is not a standalone app, but a library to work in conjunction with other apps, like:
https://github.com/jtrotsky/spate (Sales report export)
https://github.com/jtrotsky/so-report (Consignment report export)

Please use the above as an example of how to use the library. 

DISCLAIMER:
This is by no means endorsed by Vend, and is a library built for Vend's experimental 2.x API so should be used with caution.
